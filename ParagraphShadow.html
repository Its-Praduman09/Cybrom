    <p><b>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a 
       unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a
      section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly
       journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.</b></p>

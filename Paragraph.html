    <p>A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence 
      that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do 
      not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance,
      in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph
      can be just one sentence long.In English The Software Development Life 
      Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process that enables the production of high-quality,
      low-cost software, in the shortest possible production time. The goal of the SDLC
      is to produce superior software that meets and exceeds all customer expectations 
      and demands.
